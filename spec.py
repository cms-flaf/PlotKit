"""Engine-neutral description of a plot.

A *plotter* (e.g. :class:`~PlotKit.plotters.stacked.StackedPlotter`) turns histograms and
config into one of these specs; a *backend* (mplhep/matplotlib or cmsstyle/ROOT) renders it.
Keeping the description independent of any drawing engine is what lets PlotKit support both
``mplhep`` and ``cmsstyle`` (issue #171) and makes adding new plot styles a matter of
producing a new spec rather than touching every backend.
